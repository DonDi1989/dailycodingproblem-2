	<h2>Daily Coding Problem - #2</h2>
	<p>This problem was asked by Uber.</p>
  	<p>Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. Solve it without using division and in O(n) time.</p>
 	<p>For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].</p>
